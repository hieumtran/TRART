The Justin and Darrianne Christian Center for Diversity and Inclusion
2017
Spaces at the Center for Diversity and Inclusion offer a unique opportunity for student groups, university departments, and individual students to host events. Examples include, but are not limited to, reserving the board-room for meetings, the kitchen for cooking and food-based events, and the classrooms for group study sessions. The atrium is the most requested space and has been reserved for game nights, presentations, and luncheons.
