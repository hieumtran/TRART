West College
1879
West College was previously known as the Edifice, which was constructed in 1842, got burned in 1979 and renovated with the additions to the east and west sides of the building.  While the renovated building lacked the peculiar charm of the old Edifice, the new West College, as it was renamed, gave good service to the university for the next 50 years."  The building was declared unsafe in 1930 and demolished four years later.
