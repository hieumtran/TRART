Prindle Institute for Ethics
2007
Dedicated in 2007, the Prindle Institute for Ethics is nestled in the heart of DePauw’s Nature Park near the main DePauw campus. The innovative, sustainable design provides a space for students, faculty, and other members of our community to get away from their busy lives and reflect or work in peace.
