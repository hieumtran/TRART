F.W. Olin Biological Sciences Building
1993
Olin and its greenhouse were built in 1993, replacing an older greenhouse that stood behind Harrison Hall. At the time, the largest member of the collection was a cycad, a prehistoric plant that looks like a misshapen palm tree but is actually more closely related to other cone-producing gymnosperms, such as spruce or pine trees.
