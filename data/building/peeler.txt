The Richard E. Peeler Art Center
2002
Designed by the internationally-acclaimed architect, Carlos Jimenez, professor at Rice University's School of Architecture, the Richard E. Peeler Art Center features three spacious, state-of-the-art galleries. The building is named for Richard E. Peeler, a 1949 graduate of DePauw. Peeler returned to his alma mater in 1958 to teach ceramics, sculpture and photography.
